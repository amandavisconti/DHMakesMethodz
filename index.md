Monthlyish 30min informal, low-effort way to help folks discover methods that might interest them & how to dip their toes in.

## Each Zoom event is 30min:
1. One informal 10-20min talk:
- about 1 specific craft/make/art method (e.g. crochet, woodcarving, resin), and
- aimed at "what is this method, why might I want to try it, how would I get started?" (not a tutorial attendees follow, given coordinating supplies is hard)

2. Optional 10-20min after talk for questions, working on/sharing your own crafty/makey things

<!--
## Volunteer to present—including if you're a complete beginner
Zero expertise required to present on a method—in fact, being fairly new to a method may help others feel they can get started, too. "I'm very much just getting started, and this is what I'm learning, planning, or wondering about" is as useful as "I've been doing this a while". 
-->

## Talks focus on 
Discussing or demoing 1 method (not multiple; not expecting audience to have supplies to follow along). Up to teacher, but could cover:
* Why are you interested/excited about this method? Why might others dig trying it?
* What's challenging about the method, e.g. when starting out? Advice, encouragement?
* Any related personal projects (at any stage of completion) to share?
* Recommend tutorials, other example projects
* Supplies you'd need to try the method more inexpensively

## Why "MethodZ"?
I'll try taking notes during the talks, to turn into miniZine drafts to credit & be approved by the speaker. Could share these online & in public spaces like my Scholars' Lab zine rack (UVA).
