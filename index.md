# About the series
Monthlyish 30min informal, low-effort way to help folks discover methods that might interest them & how to dip their toes in. Email Visconti [at] Virginia.edu if you'd like to teach and/or help organize/moderate a talk, and I can add you to a GDoc to help match up prospective teachers and organizers-moderators (I'm at my capacity limit for organizing with these first 3 talks, but it would rock if others want to make more happen!)

## Each Zoom event is 30min:
1. One informal 10-20min talk:
- about 1 specific craft/make/art method (e.g. crochet, woodcarving, resin), and
- aimed at "what is this method, why might I want to try it, how would I get started?" (not a tutorial attendees follow, given coordinating supplies is hard)

2. Optional 10-20min after talk for questions, working on/sharing your own crafty/makey things

<!--
## Volunteer to present—including if you're a complete beginner
Zero expertise required to present on a method—in fact, being fairly new to a method may help others feel they can get started, too. "I'm very much just getting started, and this is what I'm learning, planning, or wondering about" is as useful as "I've been doing this a while". 
-->

## Talks focus on 
Discussing or demoing 1 method (not multiple; not expecting audience to have supplies to follow along). Up to teacher, but could cover:
* Why are you interested/excited about this method? Why might others dig trying it?
* What's challenging about the method, e.g. when starting out? Advice, encouragement?
* Any related personal projects (at any stage of completion) to share?
* Recommend tutorials, other example projects
* Supplies you'd need to try the method more inexpensively

## Why "MethodZ"?
I'll try taking notes during the talks, to turn into miniZine drafts to credit & be approved by the speaker. Could share these online & in public spaces like my Scholars' Lab zine rack (UVA).

# What is "#DHmakes"?
#DHmakes is loosely folks in digital humanities/libraries/academia/learning-work who craft/make (including as non-job hobby), open to anyone interested. We use the #DHmakes hashtag to share our in-progress make/craft work, ask questions, cheer each other on, and collaborate (e.g. on conference sessions, craft projects, writing). A couple of us [blogged more about #DHmakes](https://literaturegeek.com/2024/09/26/what-is-dhmakes-hashtag)—what it is, why it's cool, how to get involved.

Check out the [Bluesky #DHmakes feed](https://bsky.app/profile/literaturegeek.bsky.social/feed/aaadokeexl2vo). If you aren't on Bluesky, check out Amanda's [friendly Bluesky quickstart & detailed guides](https://tinyurl.com/DHBluesky) which are updated regularly and especially aimed at folks in academic, GLAM, DH, and related knowledge work. And let [Amanda](https://bsky.app/profile/literaturegeek.bsky.social) know if you join so they can follow you!
